To discover information about cpu's in a server/node:
```
dmidecode -t processor
```
```	
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```
	
We can obtain the number of processors in different ways:
```
$ htop
```
it shows at the top the graphic of every processor
```
$ lscpu
```
```
$ nproc --all
```
```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo  | more
```

Command to get info from a particular process:
```	
ps --no-headers -u process_name | sed -e 's/\^\[[:space:]]*//' | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs -I pid pidstat -p pid 1 10
```
